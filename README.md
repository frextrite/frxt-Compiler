# frxt-Compiler
compiler for frxt language - nothing more than a tool to learn Compiler Design

The main goal is to create a full-fledged compiler which will compile `sample.frxt`
to underlying C language.

Note: If this seems interesting I may even compile it down to x86 assembly, but I don't
have any motive to do that as of now.
